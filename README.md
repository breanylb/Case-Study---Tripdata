# Case-Study---Tripdata
  This case study was given at the end of my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. To discover valuable insights from bike ride data given. I was tasked with identifying the difference between casual riders and annual members' usage of Cyclistc bikes to present findings to the stakeholders.
    I was required to produce a report with the following deliverables:
      1. A clear statement of the business task
      2. A description of all data sources used
      3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
      4. A summary of your analysis
      5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
      6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis
